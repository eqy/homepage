Searching through 120,000 music modules to find that elusive uncredited video
soundtrack.
</h3>

demo video featuring unsynchronized audio.

<p>Popular services like Shazam and Midomi have made music identification
easy, provided that you're trying to find a song in their database. But what
happens when the song you're searching for isn't in their database--when you
know for certain that it won't be in their database?
</p>

<h4>2005-2006: Motivation: Uncredited Tom's Hardware Video Soundtracks</h4>
<p>Usually you're just SOL and hope that some hero comments on the video you
just watched with something other than "Song Name: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Darude - Sandstorm</a>". In
2005-2006, I stumbled upon a set of videos produced by Tom's Hardware. As a
newbie-PC builder at the time I was interested by their content; who doesn't
want to see a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAVGs9FbmnM">Pentium 4
overclocked to 5GHz under LN2</a>, a PC <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ8L1Prl6tk">cooled with vegetable
oil</a>, or what happens (before throttling and shutdown became ubiquitous) when
you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNUK3U73SI">removed the heatsink
on a running processor</a>.
</p>

<p>
I was also entranced by the music used in these videos. I had never heard
anything quite like it as someone who only experienced the days of the Amiga--I
only knew the world of sampled mp3s and wavs. The closest thing I had ever heard
to a music module was a midi played back using whatever terrible sample library
shipped with Windows XP by default.

If you're looking for the soundtracks for these two videos, they can be found here:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-CnsQ4BqfY">Anvil - Path to Nowhere</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4luaY7Oc24">Karsen - Aryx</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNLSa2CdpXk">Acecream - Love Me!</a>
<a

Ion - Fifth</a>

<p>
As the soundtracks were never credited in the videos (I wasn't even on YouTube
at the time to even begin checking the comments there), I gave up hope of
tracking down the music. 
</p>

<h4>2007-2008: Discovering "Keygen" Music</h4>
<p>
A few years later, after I had discovered the genre of "keygen music," a term
that is itself really just a bootleg for module or tracker music, I downloaded a
"keygen music pack" that contained the song <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31TkIDcmTRA">Reed - Dansze Mucyka</a>. I
recognized it immediately as the source for <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oLQqBjU9eY">this</a> Tom's Hardware
video. I now knew that this type of music existed originally in the form of
module formats, but I was stuck with the misconception that "keygen" music packs
were the primary source of tracker music. The fact that "keygen" music often
came mislabeled (labeled based on the keygen they were ripped from and not the
actual composer) didn't help and I didn't find of the other tracks.
</p>

<h4>2013-2014: YouTube comment heroes, getting 90% of the way there</h4>
<p>
Fast forward another few years, and on a whim I decided to visit those old Tom's
Hardware videos on YouTube just for fun. This time, however, most of the videos
had comments detailing where the modules used for the soundtracks came from, and
some quick googling revealed <a href="http://modarchive.org">the modarchive</a>
to be the definitive source for modules. Eventually, I discovered that the vast
majority of songs used in Tom's Hardware videos were shamelessly ripped from the
<a href="http://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_chart&query=featured">list
of featured modules</a> on the modarchive, with the time the module was featured
roughly corresponding to the release date of the videos. This list should have
been the last piece in the puzzle to getting the soundtracks to all of the
videos, but unfortunately there was a big black hole circa 2004-2005 where the
featured module list was not updated. Soundtracks for videos such as the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1hg1zf7rrY"> Intel Pentium 560 Heat
Problems</a> would remain unidentified. 
</p>

<h4>2015: New Possibilities</h4>
<p>
On the surface, simply knowing that a song came from a tracker music file
doesn't seem to be a whole lot of useful information. I didn't think it told me
anything obvious other than that a Shazam or Midomi search wouldn't work.
However, if you look a little deeper, a few factors come together that make a
ridiculous project like Molasses possible. They are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A Smaller and Mostly Mapped Universe.</b>
There aren't actually that many tracker music files out there. The entire
snapshot of the modarchive up to 2007 (which is presumably reasonably
exhaustive), <i>only</i> contains ~120,000 songs. 
</li>
<li><b>Modules are Pretty Small and not Projected by the RIAA.</b>
The <b>entire</b> archive is <i>freely</i> available in compressed form as a torrent <a
href="http://tracker.modarchive.org/">on the modarchive tracker page</a>. Size?
<b>~29GiB</b>. Imagine how much space 120,000 mp3s would take up, even at a low
bitrate of 128kbps.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Molasses: Implementation</h3>
<p>
Molasses was born out of these possibilities, but the ease of availability of
projects such as <a href="https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu">dejavu</a> were
what really made things doable. It turns out that storing the fingerprints of
120,000 songs in a mysql database (as dejavu is implemented) isn't exactly
feasible for a single user (estimated 500GiB to 1TiB needed), especially if I
only intend on performing a few searches. Instead of fingerprinting the target
song and matching it against an index of pre-fingerprinted songs, molasses
fingerprints everything on the fly to save disk space. 
</p>

<p>
<a
href="http://willdrevo.com/fingerprinting-and-audio-recognition-with-python/">The
FFT-based fingerprinting algorithm used in </a>dejavu works well with tracker
music, so long as the modules are converted to a sampled format beforehand. This is
"easily" done with gstreamer-based tools such as soundconverter. Ostensibly, all
that needed to be done was convert 120,000 modules to wav via soundconverter,
fingerpint them, and finally match them.
</p>

<h4>soundconverter bugs</h4>
<p>
Unfortunately, some of the songs in the mod archive seem to induce nasty and
unrecoverable bugs in soundconverter. Most of them seem to be reasonably begign,
causing soundconverter to hang and produce a 0-byte wav file. I just hoped that
the song I was looking for didn't happen to be one of these "buggy" modules.
However, sometimes, a buggy module produces the opposite behavior, where
soundconverter will just continue writing garbage to a wav file, sometimes in
excess of 10GiB. With 120,000 total modules, garbage wav files will eat a hard
disk quickly if unchecked. In the end, I "remedied" these problems with a simple
timeout counter for the soundconverter subprocess and by deleting wav files once
they are fingerprinted.
</p>

<h4>performance</h4>
<p>
As you can imagine, trying to match a song against 120,000 candidates takes a
long time, and this is where Molasses gets its name. However, it doesn't take
<i>that</i> long, and modules can be fingerprinted at roughly 10X real-time speed on a
fairly modern multicore CPU (molasses uses the multiprocess module for parallel
processing). All in all, it takes on the order of a few days to
fingerprint the entire 2007 snapshot.
</p>

<p>Even if a few days sounds like a long time, it's nothing compared to the
first implementation of Molasses, which is on the order of <b>40X</b> slower
than the version that was eventually used to search the mod archive.
</p>

<p><b>The first 10X performance improvement</b> was reached by using a non-totally naive
data-structures for matching fingerprints of songs. Each song produces hundreds
of thousands of fingerprint-time pairs, which are then compared with
other songs. Comparing two songs (a, b) involves checking if song b has a
matching fingerprint with song a for every fingerprint in song a, and storing
the offset between the fingerprint times for each song if there is a match.
Naively, if fingerprint-time pairs are store in flat lists or arrays, comparing
songs is an O(n²) operation. Storing things as maps from fingerprints->lists of
times changes this to an "O(1)."
</p>

<p><b>The second 4X* performance improvement</b> was reached by using
parallel processing via the multiprocessing module. Making things
multiprocessing-friendly was relatively straightforward, all that had to be
done was a quick hack to pack the state of an object so that it could be handled
by a function acceptable by Pool.map().
