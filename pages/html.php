It is arguable that simply looking at the code for these pages defeats the purpose of using this page as a tutorial or refresher for topics visited while twiddling with the website. Instead, an ongoing list is presented to document the ideas considered.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Simple page generation, linking, bare fundamentals of HTML</li>
<li>Framesets, distinctions between Framesets and IFrames
	<ul>
	<li>Identifying how to create a "menu bar" with Framesets, (Targets, etc.)
	</ul>
<li>Ordered and unordered lists (meta LOL)
<li>Comments in HTML
<!-- I find the syntax for comments to be rather odd 
Maybe that's because I've gotten too used to c-like languages
--> 
</ol>
