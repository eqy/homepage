<h1 class="header"> Eddie's homepage </h1>

<p>
This website is hosted on questionable computer hardware with possibly even more questionable network hardware and resources. It is intended as a sort of glorified sandbox while possibly maintaining some semblance of practicality--the practicality being in maintaining some loose documentation of my exploration of technology (as vague as that sounds).

<br />
Note: If the domain you are on looks something like linux.ucla.edu, then the hardware and network resources are somewhat less questionable. (See the Webserver page for more details)

<h2>Anticipations</h2>
<p>
I cannot forsee additions to this page, but I am very interested to what additions to this website entail. I may revive some older projects done in HTML/PHP, but at the very least, document technological adventures.
